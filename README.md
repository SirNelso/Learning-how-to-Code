Hello,
my name is Nils. I am a student from Germany. This is my path to becoming a software developer. I am in the first year of a Bachelor in Software Design.
This is my personal documentation about my progress and path to becoming a software developer.
Most of the comments will be in German, as it is my native language. Depending on my mood, I will also write in English. Some of the tasks are from my professor, some I do myself to practice.
